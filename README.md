--Philosophers--

**Description**

The Philosophers is project that simulates the famous dining philosophers problem, proposed by Edsger Dijkstra.
The goal is to learn and implement fundamental concepts of threads, mutexes, and process synchronization.

An N amount of philosophers sit around a table with a bowl of spaghetti.
Between each pair of philosophers there is a fork. To eat, a philosopher needs two forks (the left one and the right one).
Philosophers have to alternate between three states: eating, sleeping and thinking.

The challenge is to prevent philosophers from starving while waiting to eat.
